# Specification Quality Checklist: Document inbox

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2026-10-21
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs) — module names (expenses, supplier invoices, linking, partners) name the owners of behaviour, not code
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain — Q1–Q7 of the harvest were answered (D27, D32); the one new default is recorded under Assumptions (inbox membership = no decision yet) for the owner's read
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- Validated 2026-10-21 against the harvest (`harvest.md` §2–§8) and D27 / D32. Ready for the owner's read, then `/speckit-plan`.
